# ITM695-X Assignments Repo

In the last portion of the class you will be required to complete an
assignment. This is intended to reinforce the class learning and give you
and opportunity to test your knowledge and recognize (and correct) any shortcomings. 
You have until 4pm before the next class to submit your work. 

You can use the internet (google is your friend here) and/or refer to any class notes, but
this should be your own individual work.

You will need to complete this assignment without the professors help, nor any help
from fellow students.

Each assignment must be "pushed" to your personal repo (ST???) under the appropriately
named folder (Class01, Class02, ... ,  Class10)

If no specific file names are mentioned in the assignment, use any file
naming your feel is appropriate for the submission (BUT, any files submitted
must be stored within the appropriately named folder (Class01, Class02, ... ,  Class10)
