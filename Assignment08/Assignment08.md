# Assignment08

Find a python based project somewhere on GitHub. Fork, and close the repo to your local drive (somewhere outside your classroom repos). Once downloaded, run a static security analysis on the project using Bandit. Save the results in secan.html. Copy secan.html into your private repo in the directory Assignments/Assignment08 and push this to your repo. YOU MUST ALSO, add a README.md file (with the Assignment08 folder) that provides a brief description of the repo you choose (with link) including a link to your secan.html outout.
