# Assignment #3


### Part01 - Using user input to initialize turtle graphics

Write a program called TurtleColor that asks a user for a color and sets the color of a turtle to this value. Then, write the code necessary to draw a circle with a radius of 100 pixels.

> NOTE1: You will need to review the [official Python documentation on turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle) to find which methods to use to set the turtle color. This is part of the assignment.

> NOTE2: You may notice that improper input will result in generating an exception (for instance, try entering XGFSSD for the color). Later in the course, we'll be covering how to "catch" such exceptions to better handle these situations.

## Part02 - Write your initials using turtle graphics

Create a folder within your Assignments repo call Assignment02

Inside the Assignmnet02 folder, create NameWriter.py

Inside NameWriter.py, write a program that uses turtle graphics to display your initials (first, middle and last).

Once you have completed this program, push it to your personal repo.

NOTE: If you have more than three names, just use the initials of your first two names and your last name.

##  Part03 -  Super Namewriter

> Challenge questions are not mandatory. You can receive 5 points if you submit a working version of the required program (there will be no partial points). You have under the start of next class to submit your response to the challenge question.

Within the Assignment02 folder, create a program called SuperNameWriter.py that prints your name 5 times, each time 5 pixels up and to the right from the previous name.
