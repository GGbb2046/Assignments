#Assignment 02

## Part01

You will create and run your first python program using vscode.
 
By convention/tradition the first program a new programmer writes is a "hello world" program. This is about as simple a program we can write. It's job is to run, print the phrase "Hello World" to the screen, and then end. 

In some languages (i.e. Java) this can involve writing many lines of code. In Python, it takes only one line of code (containing the phrase `print("Hello World)`)

* Open VSCode
* Open the Assignment folder you created inside your ST?? repo. 
* Create a new folder called Assignment02
* Create a new file called helloworld.py
* In the editor that opens in vscode, write a single line of code as follows:
  `print("Hello World")`

* Make sure you save the helloworld.py file.
* open an integrated bash terminal in VSCode, 
* Run the program you just created by typing the following command:
  `python3 helloworld.py`
* take a screen shot of your vscode window (the entire program), and save it as a file called hellopic. 
* Commit, and push these changes to your github repo. 

## Part02

Search for and find an interesting repo that you can fork/copy. Using VSCode, create an md file called git_link.md in your Assignments02 folder. Copy the link to the repo into this file. Save the file, commit, and push the update to your github (ST??) repo. 

## Part03

Update the README.md file found in the root of your ST?? repo to use markdown. Inside this file, you must include your First and Last name, Major, something about you (like an about me page), and a picture.
